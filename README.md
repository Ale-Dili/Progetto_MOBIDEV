* **Gathering**
  This app records sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope), and can also be used to extract feature in order to create the training set. The recording
  of the data is available with both iPhone and Apple Watch.

* **Boulder predictor**
  This app uses the model trained with CreateML in order to classify which boulder problem was climbed by the user
